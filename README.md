# Project 6 - ParseInstagram

ParseInstagram is a photo sharing app using Parse as its backend.

Time spent: 15 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] User can sign up to create a new account using Parse authentication
- [X] User can log in and log out of his or her account
- [X] The current signed in user is persisted across app restarts
- [X] User can take a photo, add a caption, and post it to "Instagram"
- [X] User can view the last 20 posts submitted to "Instagram"

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Show the username and creation time for each post
- [ ] After the user submits a new post, show a progress HUD while the post is being uploaded to Parse.
- [ ] User Profiles:
   - [ ] Allow the logged in user to add a profile photo
   - [ ] Display the profile photo with each post
   - [ ] Tapping on a post's username or profile photo goes to that user's profile page

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- [X] Users can use an edited photo to display instead of the original image. For example, they can post a cropped photo instead of the whole image.
- [X] Added RefreshControl. When the user posts a photo, it transitions to the Timeline

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Heroku was being tricky with me.
2. Parse is also awesome, but it can be slow sometimes

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I can honestly say that I had no major struggles with this app. I need some better explanation of the tab bar controller, but everything else is set.
